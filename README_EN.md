<h3>General information</h3>

---
Rabbit Hole is a program that provides a hidden and secure storage facility for storing textual information.

<br>
<h3>Installation and first launch</h3>

---
To install the program, [select](https://github.com/KiberGod/android-password-storage/releases) the required version or download the latest one:

[Download Rabbit Hole v.3.19](https://github.com/KiberGod/android-password-storage/releases/download/v3.19/rabbit-hole-v.3.19-release.apk)

During the installation process, you may receive a message from the Play protection system about "unknown developer" or "unknown source of the application". This is because the application is not available in the Play Store. Therefore, before installing, you need to give permission for "installation from unknown sources" in the phone settings.

To enter the program's internal storage, you need to enter a password in the calculator. The important thing is not the text that appears on the screen, but the sequence of keystrokes. To reset the sequence and start entering the password from the beginning, press the "AC" button.

> Standard password: 7-,93

After logging into the storage, I recommend that you immediately familiarize yourself with the following FAQ sections:
* Login to Rabbit Hole
* Security
* Use and distribution

You can get to the FAQ via: Tools > RSS > FAQ
